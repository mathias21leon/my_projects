EDA con enfoque descriptivo para evaluacion de rendimiento estudiantil
# Objective

The objective of this project was to determine whether there were performance gaps between genders in exams. Additionally, it aimed to investigate whether students with free lunch had lower performance compared to those without free lunch, create graphs to visualize grade distribution, present a trends report, and identify which groups of students might require additional support.

## About the Dataset

The dataset was relatively small (**1000 rows x 8 columns**). It contained information on the results of three exams: **reading, writing, and mathematics**. Additionally, it included columns with details such as **parental education level** and **student ethnicity**, as well as whether they had taken a test preparation course.  

From the beginning, the last two mentioned columns were discarded as they were not useful for the analysis.

## Steps Taken

1. The dataset was explored to determine which columns would be used, check for missing values in the relevant columns, decide how to handle them, and prepare the dataset for the analysis.

2. Work began on the previously mentioned objectives.

## Project Conclusion

1. When analyzing whether there were gaps in exam results, it was determined that there was no significant gap. However, with a small difference:
   - **Female students** performed better in **reading and writing** exams.  
   - **Male students** performed better in the **mathematics** exam.  

   Although there was a difference in performance between genders, it was not significant enough to be considered a performance gap.

2. It was observed that students with **free lunch** had **lower grades** compared to those who paid for their lunch.

3. It was identified that students whose parents had **"High School"** and **"Some High School"** education levels should receive **additional support** from the school, as they had the **lowest median scores** in their grades.
